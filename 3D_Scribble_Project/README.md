# 3D Scribble Project

This project allows users to draw on a blank canvas, which is then converted into a 3D interactive model. The model can also respond to voice commands.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- Matplotlib
- Blender Python API (bpy)
- SpeechRecognition
- PyAudio

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

2. Draw on the canvas that appears.
3. The drawing will be processed and converted into a 3D model.
4. Use voice commands to interact with the model.

## Note

Make sure to have Blender installed and properly configured to use the bpy module.
